# LBM on Quadratic MCF problem

Project for "Computational Mathematics for Learning and Data Analysis" course (a.y. 2021-2022) at the University of Pisa. The project consists in the implementation of a dual approach to solve a convex Quadratic Min-Cost Flow problem, where the Lagrangian Dual is solved by a level bundle method. More details can be found in the [report](https://github.com/Simoniuss/LBM-on-Quadratic-MCF-problem/blob/main/report/_CM__Project_report.pdf).

## Project tour

The project is structured as follows:
- `src`: contains the source code of the project.
- `report`: contains report and papers used for the mathematical formulation of the problem.
